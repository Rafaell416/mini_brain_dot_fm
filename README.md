# Running the Mini Brain.fm React Native App

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Expo CLI (you can install it globally by running `npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Expo app locally:

1. Clone the project [repository](https://github.com/Rafaell416/api_mini_brain_dot_fm.git) or extract the project files to a local directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies specified in the package.json file:

```
npm install
```

## Starting the App

Start the development server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server and display a QR code in the terminal.

To run the app on a physical device, make sure you have the Expo Go app installed. You can download it from the App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android).

Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal. This will build the JavaScript bundle and load the app on your device.

If you want to run the app on an emulator or simulator, you can choose the respective options from the Expo developer tools.
